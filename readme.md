# How to impress your stakeholders with an outstanding demonstration

OPTION 1
The review of each ceremony is one recurent opportunity to show your latest development to the stakeholders.
Each ceremony starts with a demonstration. Stakeholders, among which lies your sponsor, may not be as aware of the product most recent features as your product owner is. This is the perfect time to demonstrate your team's capacity to suceed and to adress their problem.

OPTION 2
Each ceremony can be a good oportunity to show off the most recent development of the client product. The review is the time to make each stakeholder catch up with the latest improvements of their investment.

## What is a demonstration ?

A demonstration is a privileged time shared between the complete developping team and stakeholders. It shall last no longer than 15 minutes.

> I only believe what I can see.

Tickets in a done column is one thing, the corresponding features demonstrated live is another. The demonstration shows the current state of your client's product and roots a commonly shared picture of what's remaining to be developped. 
It allows the stakeholders to :
* acknowledge the success of the past sprint 
* introduce the focal point of the developpments to be undertaken during the next sprint. 

It is the perfect introduction to a ceremony's review.

#### What you need to run a demonstration :
* Your computer. Only yours should be in use during the duration of the demonstration. Take this chance to involve as many persons as possible in your demonstration.
* A large screen or a projector to display your demonstration onto.
* Your stakeholders, especially your sponsor.

## Prepare your demonstration

A good demonstration is a prepared demonstration.

#### What you absolutely want to avoid during your demonstration :
* A glitch : everything shall work as planned
* An internet outage : it will delay your review, and consequently will shift your ceremony's end
* Off-handed, uninterested, distracted stakeholders : this demonstration is for them, and for them only

#### Minimize as much as possible the quantity of tasks to be run before your demonstration can start :
* If possible, unwind your full demonstration beforehand to ensure no glitch will surprize you during the real thing.
* Add the entities you may need for the purpose of the demonstration to your database the day before.
* Make sure your staging environment is up and running. This environment, being the most flexible, is most likely the easiest one to play with. You don't want to introduce fake data in production during your demonstration, neither suffering from your local machine being slower than the production is.
* Make sure you are connected to internet. You would not want to start your demonstration with problems.

The guide line of your demonstration is the *past sprint goal*. But you shall adapt the features you want to show depending on your stakeholders presence during the last ceremonies.

Insist on the weak points the product had before this sprint's developpment, and how beneficial your team is for your client's product.
> Before your team had to manually follow up company's client on an excel spreadsheet, they can now add, edit and delete customers with only a few clicks.

None of the features you developped during the past sprint isn't worth being demonstrated. The day before, read through the done column of your sprint and order the developped features based on a normal use scenario of the product.

> When you click on the *add* button on the top left corner, you can add a new customer.
> Once the customer added, you are redirected to the list of existing customer.
> We can now delete or update our newest customer using the corresponding buttons on the top left corner.

Don't use tricky tools to speed up your demonstration. The persons that will use your product may not have your skills. They will feel outsided if they can't reproduce your exact gestures. Don't skip any part of the process you may assume obvious. You are familiar with the new features of the product, your stakeholders aren't.

> When you click on the *add* button on the top left corner, you can add a new customer.

When you need to fill in fake data to demonstrate your feature, use stakeholders related fake data. For exemple, if you need to add a new customer, act as if your new customer was your sponsor. Saying his name out loud will catch his attention.

* You

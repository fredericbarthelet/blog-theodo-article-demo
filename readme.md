# How to impress your stakeholders with an outstanding demonstration

Each ceremony is a good oportunity to show off the most recent development of the product. The review is the time to make each stakeholder catch up with the latest improvements of their investment.

## What is a demonstration ?

A demonstration is a privileged time shared between the scrum team and the stakeholders. It shall last no longer than 15 minutes.

> I only believe what I can see.

The stakeholders are not following on a daily basis the evolution of the product. They want to see the result of your work. The demonstration shows the current state of the product and what's remaining to be developped. 
It allows the stakeholders to:
* acknowledge the success of the past sprint.
* introduce the focal point of the developments to be undertaken during the next sprint. 

It is the perfect introduction to a ceremony's review.

## Prepare your demonstration

A good demonstration is a prepared demonstration.

#### What you absolutely want to avoid during your demonstration:
* A glitch : everything shall work as planned
* An internet outage or a malfunctionning server : it will delay your review, and consequently will shift your ceremony's end
* Off-handed, uninterested, distracted stakeholders: this demonstration is for them, and for them only

In order to avoid previously mentionned situations, the following steps will maximize your chances of succes.

#### Required material to run a demonstration:
* Your stakeholders, especially your sponsor.
* Your application running. Avoid local environment (too slow) and production (you can't master production data)
* Your computer. You need your client's focus, their don't need their computer.
* A large screen or a projector to display your demonstration onto.

#### Preparation of your demonstration
* *You need to know what to show :* check when your sponsor was present at a demo before this one. Gather all developments carried out during this period of time.
* *You need to master the data you will use to demonstrate :* add the entities you may need for the purpose of the demonstration to your environment database the day before.
* *You need to master the behavior of your application :* if possible, unwind your full demonstration beforehand to ensure no glitch will surprize you during the real thing.

## Run your demonstration

### Who should present ?

Ideally, a developper should lead the demonstration.
* Scrum master may struggle preparing the working environment for the demonstration
* Architects might not be aware of the full range of the features developped during the sprint, as they are commited to multiple projects at once

You may also offer any of the stakeholder to run the presentation. The demonstration shall not turn into a user feedback, but it will consequently increase interest of your stakeholder into your product. Especially if they are not themselves among the final users of the product. - Reformuler. Rappel au sponsor de la review de la semaine dernière. Pourquoi se servir de cette feinte

### How to present ?

The guide line of your demonstration is the *past sprint goal*. But you shall adapt the features you want to show depending on your stakeholders presence during the last ceremonies.

Insist on the weak points the product had before this sprint's developpment, and how beneficial your team is for your client's product.
> Before your team had to manually follow up company's client on an excel spreadsheet, they can now add, edit and delete customers with only a few clicks.

None of the features you developped during the past sprint isn't worth being demonstrated. The day before, read through the done column of your sprint and order the developped features based on a normal scenario of the product.

> When you click on the *add* button on the top left corner, you can add a new customer.
> Once the customer added, you are redirected to the list of existing customer.
> We can now delete or update our newest customer using the corresponding buttons on the top left corner.

The persons that will use your product may not have your skills. During your demonstration, you are no longer a developper. You endorse the role of the final user of the product, act accordingly.
They will feel outsided if they can't reproduce your exact gestures. Don't skip any part of the process you may assume obvious. You are familiar with the new features of the product, your stakeholders aren't.

> When you click on the *add* button on the top left corner, you can add a new customer.
> You're redirected to a new page asking you to fill in the customer's name and address.
> Let's fill in this form accordingly.
> ... -> utiliser le site comme il est utilisé pendant les user feedbacks - s'adapter sur le niveau de tes stakeholders. Ne pas remplir des id sur l'url. Ne pas utiliser ton historique d'url.

When you need to fill in fake data to demonstrate your feature, use stakeholders related fake data. For exemple, if you need to add a new customer, act as if your new customer was your sponsor. Saying his name out loud will catch his attention.

> When you click on the *add* button on the top left corner, you can add a new customer.
> You're redirected to a new page asking you to fill in the customer's name and address.
> Edouard, let's fill you in !
> ...

Like any presentation, your audience has 2 focuses point you have to deal with:
* You
* The screen you are using to broadcast your demonstration

You want to make sure they simultaneously see what you do and hear what you say. 
* Describe what you do as you do it. If there is no gesture linked to what you are saying, it might not be worth saying it at all. 
* Don't excessively move your mouse or click anywhere. Fight your usual nervous tics. They should only see what needs to be done.

## Prepare your demonstration

A good demonstration is a prepared demonstration.

The guide line of your demonstration is the past sprint goal. But you shall adapt the features you want to show depending on your stakeholders presence during the last ceremonies.

Insist on the weak points the product had before the sprint's developpment, and how beneficial your team is for your client's product

Don't use tricky tools to speed up your demonstration. The persons that will use your product may not have your skills. They will feel outsided if they can't reproduce your exact gestures. Don't skip any part of the process you may assume obvious. You are familiar with the new features of the product, your stakeholders aren't.
